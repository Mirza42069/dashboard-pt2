 * Sonner, with error toasts that wait to be dismissed.

 * Sonner's default is 4 seconds for everything. That is right for "Project
 * created" — the work succeeded, the toast is a receipt — and wrong for "Could
 * not save the project", where the message is the only account of what went
 * wrong and it evaporates while the user is still reading the form.
 *
 * Deliberately only the three methods this app calls rather than a re-export of
 * the whole surface — a wrapper that forwards everything invites someone to
 * reach past it for `toast.warning` and quietly lose the behaviour. Add a
 * method here when a call site needs one.
 *
 * Import from here rather than from "svelte-sonner" directly.
