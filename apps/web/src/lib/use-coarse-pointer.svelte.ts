 * Whether any available pointer is coarse, including a hybrid laptop's screen.

 * For controls that cannot mean the same thing on both: an icon that explains
 * itself on hover and navigates on click has no hover half on a tablet, so the
 * tap has to do the explaining instead. A media query and not a user-agent
 * sniff, and subscribed rather than read once, because a convertible laptop
 * changes its answer while the page is open.
 *
 * The server and the first client paint both answer `false`. That is the safe
 * guess to be wrong about: the fine-pointer branch is a plain link, which still
 * works under a finger, whereas a tap on the coarse branch's popup trigger
 * would do nothing at all until hydration corrected it.
