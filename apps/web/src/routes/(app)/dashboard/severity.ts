/**
 * How urgent something is, in three steps.
 *
 * This module decides *which* level a row is at, and nothing about how that
 * level is drawn — each component keeps its own table for that (`FILL` in
 * tick-bar, `TONE`/`CHIP` in filter-cards, `EDGE`/`SIGNAL_TONE` in
 * attention-list), because a fill, a chip tint and a 2px edge want different
 * values of the same idea. What must not be decided twice is the level itself,
 * so it lives here alone, like permissions.ts and deviation.ts: one place
 * decides, and it can be tested without rendering anything.
 *
 * Three steps and not five. The question a portfolio screen answers is "where
 * do I look first", and a scale finer than late / waiting / settled stops
 * answering it — two shades of amber are two things to compare rather than one
 * thing to notice.
