/**
 * Server-side user-facing copy.
 *
 * A second dictionary, deliberately separate from `apps/web/src/i18n`. That one
 * is not a dependency of `apps/server` and cannot become one without moving it
 * into a shared package — the constraint already documented at the top of
 * `apps/server/src/project-export.ts`. These two dictionaries share almost no
 * strings, so giving the server its own home is cheaper than the move, and it
 * keeps UI copy out of the API's dependency graph.
 *
 * This file is the master: its shape is the contract `id.ts` is checked against.
 * Nothing in `lib/messages` may import anything outside it — no `db`, no
 * `@trpc/server` — so it stays testable without a database and importable from
 * both the tRPC routers and the Hono routes.
 *
 * Rule for what belongs here: a message earns a translation if a non-engineer
 * could plausibly see it and there is something they could do about it. A
 * message that can only be reached by a bug, a forged request or a bad deploy
 * stays English at its throw site — its only audience reads logs.
